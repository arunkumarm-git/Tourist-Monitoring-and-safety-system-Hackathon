# 🧭 HAKUNA MATATA – Smart Tourist Safety System

### 🚨 Problem Statement
Tourist safety remains a growing concern across popular destinations. Current systems lack **real-time monitoring**, **tamper-proof audit trails**, and **data verifiability**.  
**Hakuna Matata** is designed to safeguard tourists by combining **AI-based anomaly detection**, **blockchain verification**, and **privacy-preserving monitoring**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect suspicious behavior or deviations from safe zones.  
- Provide **real-time alerts** for authorities to take immediate action.  
- Ensure **tamper-proof, auditable records** using blockchain.  
- Maintain **tourist privacy** while ensuring security and accountability.

---

## 🌍 Opportunities

Our solution enhances tourist safety in India through **real-time, data-driven monitoring**.  
It empowers authorities to detect, respond, and document incidents efficiently — building a trusted ecosystem for visitors.

**Key Benefits**
- Protect tourists from malicious or unsafe situations.  
- Enable faster and more accurate response from authorities.  
- Deliver **verifiable**, **blockchain-anchored** audit trails.  
- Demonstrate a **scalable, government-grade** solution for tourist hotspots.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

[ Tourist App ] ⇄ [ AI Risk Engine (Flask + ML) ] ⇄ [ Blockchain Layer ]
↓ ↓ ↓
[ GPS / Geo-Fence ] [ Alerts & Classifier ] [ IPFS / Audit Trail ]


**Flow:**
1. Tourist onboarding and ID generation  
2. Continuous location monitoring  
3. AI detects anomalies and triggers alerts  
4. Data hashed → stored in IPFS → anchored to blockchain for verification
